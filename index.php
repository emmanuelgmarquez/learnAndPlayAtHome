            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Reina. I'm a mama and have been teaching children from ages newborn to 6th grade since 2013. I am very passionate about children as well as helping other Mamas be successful in their experience with at-home learning. As parents and our children's first educators, our role is to facilitate growth by creating an environment that will help our kiddos to flourish. By being intentional in how we interact with our little ones each day and by taking the time to understand their different stages of development meeting milestones, homeschooling or even learning outside of school can feel fun and less daunting. I know how overwhelming this all can be for both new and experienced mothers, that's why  I am here to provide you with all of the resources you need to begin your journey in conscious parenting!</p>
